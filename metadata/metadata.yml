name: DNA Sequencing using Smith Waterman and Viterbi Algorithm_PDC
description: |-
  More and more industries are offering and utilising cloud solutions that operate on the principles of parallel and
  distributed computing. Everything will eventually be built on parallel and distributed computing, thus we want
  to contribute by parallelizing crucial algorithms like the technique for identifying hidden states and sequence
  alignment. The objective of the research is to learn about parallel and distributed computing, parallelisation of
  algorithms and also successfully propose and implement the Local sequence alignment using the smith-waterman
  algorithm and the Viterbi algorithm in a serial and parallel manner
